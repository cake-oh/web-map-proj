    <h4> Global fishing activities are expanding across the world's oceans. <br>
        Coastal countries have sovereign rights over the ocean area 200 nautical miles out from their coastlines;
        these national waters are called Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). <br> 
        Much fishing takes place inside EEZs but also outside them in the world's areas beyond national jurisdiction, also called the high seas.
    </h4>
    <p>In the map above, you can use the sliders in the corners to show which regions of the Pacific Ocean have
        high fishing activity, <br>in terms of both international fishing diversity and fishing effort in hours.
