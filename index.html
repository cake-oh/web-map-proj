    <h1> International Fishing in the Pacific Ocean </h1>

    <h4> As global fishing activities grow, countries are increasingly fishing in the same regions.
        This could potentially lead to spatial competition over fishing grounds, in both
        national waters (Exclusive Economic Zones) and areas beyond national jurisdiction (high seas).
        Because of this, it may be important to visualize <i>where</i> these crowded areas are occurring.
    </h4>

    <p>In the map below, you can toggle the two layers to show where there are hotspots of fishing activity
        and where countries with a history of conflict share fishing space.
